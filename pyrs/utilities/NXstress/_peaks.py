`PeakCollection` to `peaks` (NXreflections), `FIT` (NXprocess) mapping:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. `peaks` provides the `n_Peaks` index which identifies `FIT` entries, with the exception of the `diffractogram` which are indexed separately.

- A flattened index is used `(<phase>, h, k, l, <mask>, <scan point>)`: all <scan point> may not be present, and to support legacy code specifying the <mask> is optional,
  and it will default to the key '_DEFAULT_';  Note that <mask> was not retained as a `PeakCollection` field prior to this implementation, but it does seem to be required;

- This flattened index allows appending, however each index value must identify a *unique* entry (i.e. there can be no duplicates);

- Each combination of `(<phase>, h, k, l, <mask>, ...)` corresponds to *one* `PeakCollection` instance;

- The format guarantees exactly two things about row order, and *not* a global lexicographic sort:
  each compound key occupies one contiguous run, and `scan_point` increases within a run.  `peakCollectionRanges`
  -- the only reader-side splitter -- enforces both and checks nothing else, so a file may be "locally sorted,
  globally segmented".  A single-step write does still emit a fully sorted index, but that is a property of this
  writer, not a promise the reader relies on.  Robustness against duplicates comes from `validateNoDuplicatePeaks`
  and the contiguity check, independently of sort order.  See `plans/NXstress-prod/04b-multi-workspace-nxstress.md`
  (Decisions Log item 17), which relaxed the earlier lexicographic framing precisely so that append could be a
  plain tail-append;

- When more than one `HidraWorkspace` is written into one NXentry, the index additionally carries one
  *discriminator* column per configured field (see `_discriminator.py`).  Discriminator values are the most
  slowly varying coordinates of the sort key, so each input workspace's rows form one contiguous super-block;

2. `diffractogram` are stored as 'diffractogram_<mask key>', and indexed by <scan point>.  Any single <scan point> that does not have an entry will be filled in with `NaN`.
