            NotImplementedError: On an append, for Case B -- extending a
                compound key the entry already holds with further scan points.
                That needs a mid-array insertion rather than a tail-append and
                is deliberately out of scope. Also, on a write or an append, if

                strictly increasing (see `_validation.refuse_unreadable_scan_point_order`).

        A method rather than a property, deliberately: the answer is a live query
