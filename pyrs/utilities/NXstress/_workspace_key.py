"""
pyrs/utilities/NXstress/_workspace_key.py

The workspace key: what tells one input workspace's rows from another's in an entry.

Several `HidraWorkspace`s may share one NXentry. On disk their rows are told apart
by two things:

- the **discriminator values** of the workspace, one column per configured field
  (`_discriminator`);
- its **run**, when the entry records the run as part of the key
  (`_runs.BOUNDARY_ATTRIBUTE`). Two runs sharing every discriminator value -- two
  runs in one strain direction -- are then two workspaces, not one.

`WorkspaceKey` carries the two as separate fields. Write, validation, append and
read all build and compare keys, so the key and the rules for deriving it live
here, owned by none of them.

Typical workflow:

1. `entry_discriminator_names(wss)` and `entry_carries_run(wss)` decide, once
   per entry, which fields and whether the run go into every key.
2. `WorkspaceKey.of(ws, names, carries_run=...)` builds one workspace's key.
3. `WorkspaceKey.sort_values()` gives the key's place in the on-disk row order,
   and `describe()` names it in a message.
