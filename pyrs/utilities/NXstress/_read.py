pyrs/utilities/NXstress/_read.py

Read one NXstress entry back into `HidraWorkspace`s and their `PeakCollection`s.

Several workspaces may share one entry, so a read has to split it again:

1. `read_entry(entry, path=...)` reads the peak collections first -- in a
   multi-workspace entry they are the only record of where one workspace's rows
   end and the next begin.
2. `workspace_selections(...)` groups them by workspace key and turns each group
   into the rows of the scan-point family that workspace owns.
3. `workspace_from_nexus(...)` rebuilds one workspace from its rows.

    Each workspace's scan-point *set* is the union of its peak collections'

    independent of the order `write` happened to concatenate the inputs in.

    Membership is by `(run, scan point)` wherever the workspace key carries the
    run (`_runs.is_boundary`): every run numbers its scan points from 1, so a
