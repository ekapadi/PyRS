Each entry: the comment, the agreed resolution, and the change actually made.
My summaries of the diff are not recorded (§6e); defects I flagged are, whether or
not they were acted on.

## Batch 1 — `pyrs/utilities/NXstress/_definitions.py`

### D1 — `tail_append`'s error named the dataset `'unknown'`

**Flagged by me.** The whole value of that message is naming which dataset cannot
grow, and `NXfield.nxpath` returns the literal string `'unknown'` for a field not
attached to a tree, so the message read *"dataset 'unknown' was written at a fixed
size"*. `.nxname` is `'unknown'` too — there is genuinely no name to report.
Unreachable from the append path, which is always file-backed; reachable from a unit
test or a future in-memory caller.

**Resolution:** fix.

**Change:** new `_definitions._field_label(field)`, used by all three `tail_append`
messages. Returns `dataset '<nxpath>'` when there is a path, and
``an unattached (3,) `NXfield` `` when there is not, so the message never presents
`unknown` as a name.

### D2 — `tail_append(field, <scalar>)` raised `IndexError: tuple index out of range`

**Flagged by me.** `np.asarray(5).shape` is `()`, which passes the trailing-axis
check vacuously (a 0-d array has no trailing axes to disagree about); `values.shape[0]`
then raises an `IndexError` naming neither the field nor the problem. No current
caller passes a scalar — an unguarded contract rather than a live bug.

**Resolution:** fix.

**Change:** a `values.ndim == 0` guard before the trailing-axis check, raising
`RuntimeError` that names the field and says to pass a 1-element array. The comment
at the guard records why it must precede the trailing-axis check rather than follow it.

### D3 — `growable` advertises flexibility the writer refuses

**Flagged by me.** `growable(rank)` makes *every* axis unlimited, so `diffractogram`
goes to disk as `maxshape=(None, None)` — telling any NeXus reader the two-theta axis
can grow, when `tail_append` and `_Fit.validateAppend` both refuse exactly that.

**Reviewer:** *"I think we need to give a meaningful error message when a 'trailing
axis' append is rejected? (Assuming we don't have one already.) Also, it wasn't obvious
if we could just have the non-appendable items (e.g. 'diffractogram') NOT use the
'maxshape=(None, None)' form — what would be the implication of this?"*

**On the error message:** one already existed, in `tail_append`, and
`_Fit.validateAppend` has a domain-specific one that fires first in the append path
(*"the incoming reduced diffraction for mask `_DEFAULT_` has 25 two-theta bin(s), the
target entry 20"*). `tail_append`'s was extended to say *why*, not only *what*: "Only
the first axis grows on an append; the trailing axes are fixed when the entry is
written."

**On pinning the trailing axes — probed, not reasoned about.** Pinning works and HDF5
enforces it: `maxshape=(None, 20)` writes, an axis-0 grow succeeds, and an axis-1 grow
is refused by the library (`NeXusError: Shape incompatible with current NXfield`).
**But `(None, None)` turns out to be load-bearing for `CHUNK_SHAPE` as written** —
h5py accepts a chunk wider than the data only when that axis is unlimited:

```console
  maxshape=(None, None)  chunks=(1, 100)  data (3, 20):  OK
  maxshape=(None, 20)    chunks=(1, 100)  data (3, 20):  ValueError:
        Chunk shape must not be greater than data shape in any dimension
  maxshape=(None, 20)    chunks=(1, 20)   data (3, 20):  OK
```

So pinning drags in a shape-aware `CHUNK_SHAPE`, and two datasets must stay unlimited
regardless: `DIFFRACTOGRAM/fit` and `fit_errors` are `(0, 0)` placeholders that **spec
09** resizes on *both* axes when it fills them in.

**Resolution: keep `(None, None)`, document why.** No second change to on-disk layout
in one PR, no scope growth inside a review.

**Change:** the `growable` docstring now records the asymmetry, the h5py constraint
that causes it, the three measured cases above, and the spec-09 placeholder reason —
stating plainly that the trailing axes are *"a chunking artifact, not a contract"* and
naming the three places that enforce the real rule.

### Noted, not a defect — `__` in a log name expands ~2.5×

**Reviewer:** *"a minor question about what actually happens if an incoming identifier
includes `__` — how would this actually be encoded?"*

Each `__` becomes `__5F_`: the first underscore is escaped because its successor is an
underscore, the second passes through. Round-trips exactly —

| input | encoded | decoded |
|---|---|---|
| `a__b` | `a__5F_b` | `a__b` |
| `__foo` | `__5F_foo` | `__foo` |
| `__` | `__5F_` | `__` |
| `HB2B__CS__X` | `HB2B__5F_CS__5F_X` | `HB2B__CS__X` |
| `a____b` | `a__5F__5F__5F_b` | `a____b` |

**The durable point is the expansion against the 63-character cap.** *n* consecutive
underscores become ~2.5× their length, so a name that is comfortably short can still
fail to encode. Not live — zero of the 185 real log names in `tests/data` need an
escaped underscore at all — and it fails *loudly*, with `allowed_identifier` raising a
`ValueError` that quotes both the original and the encoded form. Recorded because the
condition is not obvious from reading the encoder. **No change.**

## Batch 6 — `pyrs/utilities/NXstress/NXstress.py`

The orchestrator: 832 insertions, 83 deletions, the largest single diff in the PR.
Two defects, one of them found by the reviewer reading my own summary back to me.

### D17 — every texture append was refused, and the instance was poisoned with it

`_rejectMaskMismatch` was the last call site in the package feeding `_diff_data_set`
keys into `nxstress_mask_names`. Batch 5 split those namespaces and converted
`_fit.py`; this one was missed. Measured:

```console
incoming via nxstress_mask_names        : ['_DEFAULT_', 'eta_-5.0', 'eta_0.0', 'eta_5.0']
incoming via nxstress_diffractogram_keys: ['eta_-5.0', 'eta_0.0', 'eta_5.0']
on disk DIFFRACTOGRAM groups            : ['eta_-5.0', 'eta_0.0', 'eta_5.0']

APPEND: RuntimeError: ... reduced-diffraction masks do not match the target entry's.
```

The injected `DEFAULT_TAG` is a key the writer never emits for an eta-only
reduction. It fires in `_classifyAppend`, so the file is untouched — but it routes
through `self._reject`, so the instance dies too.

It bites **only** when nothing reduced under the bare default mask. Every one of
the ~40 tests in `test_append.py` reduces under `{None: ...}`, where the two
functions agree, which is why the module passed over it. `_Fit.validateAppend`'s
docstring already assigns the set check here, so the owner was right and only the
function it called was wrong.

**Fixed**: `nxstress_diffractogram_keys`, and the method renamed
`_rejectDiffractogramKeyMismatch` — the defect was a name that let the wrong
function look right. Three regression tests in `TestTextureEntryAppends`.

### D18 — the length heuristic rejected legal appends (reviewer-found)

I summarised `_perScanPointDatasets` as identifying scan-point datasets by length
rather than by a maintained list, and repeated its docstring's claim that
over-matching is "the safe direction, since the only consequence is demanding
resizability of something that didn't need it."

**Reviewer:** *"that almost certainly does not work; as a counter-example, consider
the case where we have a 3-unit array of directions … and also 3 scan-points …
Obviously there aren't going to be any new 'directions' appended, nor should this
be required!"*

Correct, and the claim is the defect. The swept set feeds a resizability
**requirement**, so a false match is a rejection, not a no-op:

```console
n_scan = 3;  43 dataset(s) swept in
  FIX  entry/instrument/masks/names   shape=(3,) maxshape=(3,)
APPEND: RuntimeError: ... 1 dataset(s) in this entry were written at a fixed size
        and cannot be extended: ['entry/instrument/masks/names'].
```

Three detector masks and three scan points. `masks/names` is entry-wide, is never
grown, and is *required* by `_Instrument.validateAppend` to stay constant — so the
sweep demanded growability of the one thing the design forbids growing, and blamed
an out-of-date writer for it.

The sweep **under**-matched too, which neither of us had noticed. The peak index is
one row per (compound key, scan point), so it equals `n_scan` only while each
workspace fits exactly one peak. Fit a second phase — ordinary multi-peak work —
and `peaks/*` and both parameter groups left the pre-flight entirely, restoring
exactly the mid-mutation refusal 04c's Follow-up 3 F3.1 had hoisted out.

**The tell was in the tests.** `TestWriterEmitsResizableDatasets` carries:

> `n_scan` must not collide with any entry-wide array length, or an entry-wide
> array would be swept in and wrongly demanded to be resizable. … 7 collides with
> none of them; 3 is also safe today but only by two of those being small.

The hazard was understood precisely enough to be designed around *in a test*, and
not reported as a defect in the code.

**Fix — option 2 of three, per the reviewer.** Each module declares the datasets it
writes row-aligned (`appendableDatasets`), and `NXstress._appendableDatasets`
composes them. Exact rather than heuristic *because the caller owns the group's
layout*: inside a group NXstress writes, a field is either row-aligned — and so
`growable` — or an entry-wide scalar. `_Instrument` enumerates explicitly rather
than walking, since its non-scalar fields are mostly entry-wide arrays, which is
how this started.

Declared set: **49** datasets, against 43 swept of which one was false and the peak
index was included only by coincidence. The collision case now appends.

Rejected alternatives: excluding `instrument/masks` by location (patches the
instance, not the class), and keeping the sweep but treating non-appendable as
"not in the family" (keeps the runtime check honest about foreign files, but can
silently excuse a real field that lost `growable`).

**The property given up, and where it went.** The sweep covered a newly added field
automatically. `TestAppendableDatasetsAreDeclaredByTheirOwner::test_every_growable_dataset_has_exactly_one_owner`
now states that directly — every dataset written `growable` is declared by exactly
one module, and every declared dataset is resizable on disk — which is a stronger
guarantee than the sweep gave, and is checked against a written entry rather than
at runtime.

### O1 — `@validate_call_` restored on `_validateWorkspaceAndPeaksData`

It had the decorator before 04b; `init_group` and `_init` kept theirs. Re-added and
measured rather than assumed: the full NXstress suite passes with it. Flagged as a
genuine question first, since 04c's Follow-up 3 had already recorded one
`@validate_call_` surprise — but as an undeclared absence it was indistinguishable
from an oversight, which it appears to have been.

### O3 — withdrawn

I raised that nothing checks the per-scan-point time arrays against the scan-point
count. `SampleLogs.__setitem__` already does:

```console
ValueError: Number of values (or value rows)[2] isn't the same as number of subruns[3]
```

Raised without checking the upstream guard.

### D19 — a string log's type depended on where the workspace came from (O2, resolved)

`_entryTimes` decoded every time value unconditionally inside a `try` that
catches only `ValueError` — the clause that substitutes `NO_LOG` for an
unparseable timestamp — so a `str` log raised `AttributeError` straight past the
fallback. On the append path `_appendEntryTimes` is the **first** mutation step,
so the instance was invalidated for what was only a type mismatch.

**Reviewer:** *"why is there any ambiguity causing O2 — there doesn't seem to be a
reason to allow both bytes and str — what's causing that issue?"*

Nothing normalised. The type was decided by provenance:

| source | string log value |
|---|---|
| `HidraProjectFile.read_sample_logs` — `data_set[()]`, straight from h5py | `bytes` |
| `_Sample.sampleLogsFromNexus` | `bytes`, except `name`/`chemical_formula` decoded one-off at `:473-483` |
| built in memory from a `<U` array | `str` |

So six policies downstream: four tolerant (`summary_generator`,
`peak_profile_utility`, `_discriminator._as_text`, `HidraWorkspace.direction`),
two not (`_entryTimes`, `_fit.py:662`). Even the NXstress conftest carries the
split — it `.encode()`s `start_time`/`end_time`/`Filename` with a comment saying
it must match h5py, then writes `direction` as a `<U` array four lines later.

**Reviewer's answer to "adjust both readers?":** *"it should be bytes when at
hdf5, but probably string, when in memory. What happens if we require that?"*

Measured, both directions, all three tiers:

| | `bytes` in memory | **`str` in memory** |
|---|---|---|
| unit | 2 failed | **passed** |
| integration | 1 failed | **passed** |
| nature | one real regression: the CSV exporter wrote `# string1 = b'a constant string'` | all 83 initial failures were the *same* defect — the unconditional `.decode()` |

The asymmetry decided it: writers that must encode are few and already do it;
readers that must decode are many and mostly untested. The `str` direction also
ratifies the two deliberate normalisations already in the tree rather than
reversing them.

**Implemented (option 1, per the reviewer), then corrected twice.**

**Reviewer:** *"those sections need to go through the same conversion mechanism —
it must be centralised."* So the conversion is one pair of functions,
`to_text`/`to_text_array` in `pyrs/utilities/convertdatatypes.py` beside the
existing `to_int`/`to_float`, called at the store boundary
(`SampleLogs.__setitem__`), at the HDF5 boundary
(`HidraProjectFile.add_sample_log`) and at the **nine** hand-rolled sites across
five modules. Those nine had drifted into four behaviours — some handling
`numpy.bytes_`, some not; some coercing the non-bytes branch to `str`, some
returning it untouched. `_definitions.as_text` is gone; `_discriminator._as_text`
delegates.

### D20 — the first version checked the wrong dtype, and every tier was green

I claimed the one-off decodes in `_sample.py:473-483` were redundant, having
removed them and watched 465 tests pass.

**Reviewer:** *"Wouldn't the 'nxdata' in the h5py be in bytes? Why did removing
those work?! Something is not working as expected!"*

Right on both counts. `.nxdata` is bytes — but it arrives as an **object** array
of Python `bytes`, and the check was `dtype.kind == "S"`, which catches only
fixed-width arrays. Object arrays (`kind == "O"`) passed straight through:

```console
AFTER the first "fix", a round-tripped workspace:
    start_time    array-dtype=object   first=bytes    b'2024-01-15T10:00:00'
    direction     array-dtype=object   first=bytes    b'11'
    SampleName    array-dtype=<U5      first=str_     'steel'
```

Only the two fields built via `np.array([b"steel"] * n)` — which *is* `|S` —
converted, which is exactly why removing their decodes appeared to work. Three
things to record:

1. **The green tiers proved nothing here.** They passed because the intolerant
   consumers had been made tolerant, not because logs had become text.
2. **The unit test passed because its fixture was wrong.** It built
   `np.array([b"11", ...])` — the dtype the literal syntax gives, not the one the
   reader yields. A normalization test has to construct the reader's dtype.
3. **The reviewer found it by reading the claim, not the results.** Nothing in
   the output would have surfaced it.

### D21 — the encode produced fixed-width columns

`numpy.char.encode` gives `|S`, whose width is fixed by the longest value present
at creation; a longer value written later truncates **silently** — the hazard
this series had already documented for NXstress. And since `HidraProjectFile`
re-saves a workspace it previously read, it would have converted an existing
file's variable-length columns to fixed-width on every save. Now
`h5py.string_dtype(encoding="utf-8")`, matching `_Sample._writable`.

Found by writing the assertion the measurement deserved (`stored[()].dtype.kind
== "O"`) rather than the one that would pass.

### D22 — the conversion passed misuse through instead of raising

`to_text_array` returned a numeric array unchanged, because `SampleLogs` calls it
for every log and most logs are numbers.

**Reviewer:** *"Why would `to_text_array` leave numeric types untouched? In that
case it's obviously being abused and should raise an exception -- that would be a
developer 'usage' error!"*

Same mistake as D20 in miniature: a pass-through makes a misdirected call look
like a working one, and the symptom surfaces later and elsewhere. Now
`is_text_array` is public and carries the definition of "array of strings"
(including the element-wise inspection an `object` array needs), `to_text_array`
raises `TypeError` naming the dtype that arrived, and the two call sites that may
hold either kind guard with the predicate -- `SampleLogs.__setitem__` and
`_Peaks._decoded`, whose discriminator column may legitimately be numeric.
`TestIsTextArray::test_it_agrees_with_what_to_text_array_accepts` pins the two
together so they cannot drift.

**Except for an empty `object` array**, which the reviewer flagged as a
legitimate case the strict version would break — *"I can imagine a sample-log
that will be an array of bytes (on disk), but is presently empty."*

Checked, and the ambiguity is not there: an empty HDF5 dataset keeps its own
dtype on read, and only a variable-length string comes back as `object`
(`float64` stays `float64`, `|S4` stays `|S4`). So empty + `object` is
unambiguously an empty string column; it has no values to misclassify, and `<U`
is both the invariant's dtype and the data's. Empty + `float64` still raises.

It is also already reachable, and **both** previous behaviours were wrong.
`write([ws], [[]])` — the documented no-peak-fits shape — leaves `phase_name` and
`mask` as empty `object` columns, and the hand-rolled `_decoded` turned them into
`np.array([])`, i.e. **`float64`**: an empty array of numbers standing in for a
string column. Invisible because the caller returns on `len == 0` two lines
later. `to_text_array` now passes `dtype=np.str_` for precisely that case.

**Out of scope, and flagged for explicit review.** `pyrs/dataobjects/sample_logs.py`
and `pyrs/projectfile/file_object.py` are not in this plan series. Taken here on
the reviewer's judgement that *"there probably would not ever be a separate PR
about the core change"*, on condition that the commit message calls it out.

**Incidental finding, not fixed:** `summary_generator.py:169` calls
`value.decode()` and **discards the result** (`value.decode()`, not
`value = value.decode()`), which is why bytes reached that CSV header at all.
Pre-existing, unreachable under the new policy, and left for its own change.

### Also found: nothing runs the doctests

`restorable_property.py` (batch 2) and now `as_text` carry doctests, and there is
no `--doctest-modules` in `addopts` and no collector anywhere in `tests/`. They
are documentation, not tests. Recorded rather than fixed — turning them on is a
repo-wide change with its own fallout.

### Verification

**494 unit** (was 443) / 104 integration / 16 GUI; `ruff` and `mypy` clean; probe
sweep 19 OK, 1 SKIPPED (retired), 0 FAIL.
