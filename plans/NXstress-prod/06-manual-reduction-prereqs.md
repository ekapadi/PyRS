# 06 — Manual Reduction PyRS Prerequisites (not required for NXstress)

**Plan:** [NXstress GUI Hookup](README.md)
**Phase:** — (independent PyRS cleanup; not on the NXstress critical path)
**Depends on:** — (independent of all NXstress specs; can be worked in parallel)

---

## Overview

**Status update: this spec no longer blocks spec 07 or anything else in
this plan.** It was originally drafted as "before NXstress can be wired
into the ManualReductionViewer, two PyRS-side gaps must be closed" — that
premise doesn't hold once traced against the actual code:

1. `ReductionController.save_project` (`manual_reduction/pyrs_api.py:190`
   — **not** `HB2BReductionManager`, which is a different, unrelated class
   in `pyrs/core/reduction_manager.py`) is indeed `NotImplementedError`.
   But it has **zero callers anywhere in the codebase** — not from the
   viewer, not from the model's own passthrough
   (`manual_reduction_model.py:179-181`, which calls it but is itself never
   called). The manual-reduction save path that actually runs today is
   `reduce_hidra_workflow`'s automatic `reducer.save_diffraction_data(...)`
   call (`pyrs_api.py:348`), which already works — it is not blocked on
   anything here. `save_project` is orphaned code, not a live gap blocking
   users.
2. The two `nexus_conversion.py` (L118, L374) `NotImplementedError`
   branches are unrelated input-parsing gaps (an unsupported
   `TimeSeriesProperty` log type; a non-`.xml` mask-file format), reachable
   from NeXus-to-workspace *conversion*, not from any save/output-format
   path. NXstress's hookup point (spec 07,
   [07-manual-reduction-nxstress.md](07-manual-reduction-nxstress.md))
   touches `reduce_hidra_workflow`'s save step specifically, which never
   goes near either branch.

This spec remains a legitimate, independent PyRS code-quality item
(implementing an orphaned stub that may be worth a real use case someday;
auditing two unrelated input-parsing gaps) — but it is **not** a
prerequisite for NXstress work, and is not scheduled in this plan's phased
implementation sequence. Keep it as a standalone backlog item if still
wanted; do not resume treating it as a spec-07 blocker.

## Scope

**In scope:**
- Implement `ReductionController.save_project` in
  `manual_reduction/pyrs_api.py:190`
- Audit `nexus_conversion.py:118` and `nexus_conversion.py:374` —
  determine whether either branch is reachable from any manual-reduction
  path (confirmed: neither is reachable from the save/output-format path —
  see Overview); resolve (implement or safely guard) whichever is reachable
  from anything
- Unit and integration tests for the newly-implemented save path

**Out of scope:**
- Any NXstress code
- The NXstress hookup for ManualReductionViewer (spec 07 — does **not**
  depend on this spec; see Overview)
- Manual-reduction load paths (already working)

## PyRS Changes

### `pyrs/interface/manual_reduction/pyrs_api.py` — `save_project` (L190)

Implement the method. The surrounding context (`ReductionController`) holds
a `HidraWorkspace`; the save should write it out via `HidraProjectFile` (the
existing pattern used by all other viewers). Since nothing currently calls
this method, implementing it doesn't fix a live bug — it's forward-looking
groundwork for a possible future explicit "Save"/"Save As" action on
ManualReductionViewer (see the deferred `Viewer` ABC / viewer-symmetry idea
noted in the config-schema design session). The method signature and
expected output path convention should match what `ManualReductionViewer`
expects, if/when such an action is added.

`ReductionApp.save_diffraction_data` (`powder_pattern.py:224`, called from
`reduce_hidra_workflow` at `pyrs_api.py:348`) is a reasonable pattern to
reuse for `save_project`'s own implementation — but since `save_project`
has no current callers, there's no double-invocation risk either way;
delegate, wrap, or reimplement, whichever is cleanest, without needing to
preserve any existing caller's behavior.

### `pyrs/core/nexus_conversion.py` — L118 and L374

Audit each `NotImplementedError`:
- If the branch is reachable from the manual-reduction save path: implement
  it as part of this spec.
- If the branch is unreachable from the save path but reachable from other
  paths: file a separate issue and add a clear comment pointing to it.
- If the branch is dead code: remove it.

## NXstress / GUI Changes

_None._

---

## Tests

- `tests/unit/pyrs/interface/manual_reduction/test_pyrs_api.py` (new or
  extend): unit test `save_project` with a minimal `HidraWorkspace` —
  assert a valid `.h5` file is written.
- `tests/integration/test_manual_reduction_save.py` (new): run a minimal
  reduction workflow end-to-end and confirm the output file is loadable by
  `HidraProjectFile`.

---

## Delivered Feature

> **For contributors, not end users:**
> `ReductionController.save_project` — previously an unimplemented stub with
> no caller anywhere in the codebase — now has a working implementation.
> This doesn't change any current user-facing behavior: reduction's
> existing automatic save (via `reduce_hidra_workflow`) already works today
> and is unaffected. This is forward-looking groundwork, not a bug fix for
> anything currently reachable.

---

## Verification

- Unit test: call `ReductionController.save_project()` directly (no GUI
  action exists to trigger it) with a minimal `HidraWorkspace`; confirm a
  valid `.h5` file is written.
- `pytest tests/unit/pyrs/interface/manual_reduction/` — all pass.
- `pytest tests/integration/test_manual_reduction_save.py` — all pass.
- Confirm no regression: `reduce_hidra_workflow`'s existing automatic save
  continues to work unchanged (this spec doesn't touch it).
