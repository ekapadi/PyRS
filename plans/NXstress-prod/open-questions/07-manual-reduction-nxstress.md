# Open Questions — 07 ManualReductionViewer NXstress Hookup

**Spec:** [07-manual-reduction-nxstress.md](../07-manual-reduction-nxstress.md)
**Blocking:** No.

## Resolved — write mode and overlap-conflict policy don't apply here

The original pre-split spec 07 bundled append support with the
ManualReductionViewer hookup, and this file previously carried two
questions about append's write-mode API and overlap-conflict policy. Both
are resolved for *this* spec: `reduce_hidra_workflow` always writes fresh
(it has no notion of an existing entry to extend), so append is never
invoked from this pathway. The underlying questions still matter for the
append capability itself; they live in
`open-questions/04c-nxstress-append.md` Q1 and Q2.

**Chris:** My inital thought is that we an data reduction pathway should create a fresh file.

## RESOLVED — Does the suffix-dispatch branch live in `pyrs_api.py` or a separate model layer?

Originally hedged on this, pending spec 06's delegate/wrap/replace question.
Both resolved by tracing the actual code: the branch lives directly inside
`reduce_hidra_workflow` (`pyrs/interface/manual_reduction/pyrs_api.py`) —
the one place a save currently happens. `ReductionController.save_project`
(spec 06's target — not `HB2BReductionManager`, an unrelated class) has no
callers at all and was never the right place to hook in. This spec no
longer depends on spec 06.

**Chris:** Should `HB2BReductionManager` should coordinate how data are written into the NX file

**Correction:** this named the wrong class — no `HB2BReductionManager`
involvement exists in `ManualReductionViewer`'s save path at all (that name
belongs to an unrelated class in `pyrs/core/reduction_manager.py`, used
internally by `ReductionApp`). The actual coordination point, per the code,
is `reduce_hidra_workflow`, in `ReductionController`'s module
(`pyrs/interface/manual_reduction/pyrs_api.py`).

## RESOLVED — write mode / mismatched-extension handling

Superseded by the config-schema design session: `reduce_hidra_workflow`
writes once per currently-enabled format (`nxstress.enable`,
`legacy_io.enable`), never both automatically merged into ambiguity and
never gated by a caller-supplied extension. See spec 07's Overview for the
full reasoning — an explicit `project_file_name`'s extension is stripped
and ignored entirely, never validated against, never a reason to raise.
