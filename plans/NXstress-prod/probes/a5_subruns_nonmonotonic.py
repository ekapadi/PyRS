"""A5: can the *concatenated* scan-point axis be held by PyRS's own types?

04b mandates plain concatenation in workspace order -- "``concat(ws0.get_sub_runs(),
ws1.get_sub_runs(), ...)`` -- not a merge-and-sort" -- and its ``## Tests``
section specifies the case that makes the distinction bite: workspace A has
scan points ``[1, 3, 5]`` and workspace B has ``[2, 4, 6]``, so their *values*
interleave while their *positions* do not.

Nothing in 04b says what that concatenated axis is, as an object. It matters
because the only reason 04b's read side is simple is that it slices "the
scan-point family's concatenated arrays". If the concatenation has to pass
through a ``SampleLogs`` at any point, on either side, the interleaved case
cannot be represented at all -- and 04b's own specified test would be
unimplementable rather than merely awkward.

Claims under test
-----------------
1. ``04b:49-55`` / Decisions item 17 -- ``SubRuns.set`` raises unless strictly
   increasing. (Re-verified here in the *concatenation* shape, not the
   descending shape ``a5_peakcollection_ranges.py`` already covered: those are
   different failure modes and only this one is load-bearing for 04b's merge.)
2. **Unstated by 04b, and the reason this probe exists** -- whether the
   concatenated axis survives ``SubRuns`` construction at all, and therefore
   whether a merged ``HidraWorkspace`` can exist as an intermediate.
3. ``_sample.py:162`` -- ``_Sample.sampleLogsFromNexus`` does
   ``logs.subruns = SubRuns(scan_point)`` over the whole on-disk array, so a
   multi-workspace entry read *before* splitting hits claim 2 directly.
4. ``04b:304`` -- "reuse the merge logic ``HidraWorkspace.append_hidra_project``
   already implements in-memory (``pyrs/core/workspaces.py:517``)": whether that
   method takes an in-memory workspace, and whether it preserves scan points.

Per ``probes/README.md``'s failure-modes table, each claim reports the resulting
*state* rather than only the presence or absence of an exception -- "accepted"
is not "harmless", and for claim 4 the accepted-but-renumbered case is exactly
the silent one.
