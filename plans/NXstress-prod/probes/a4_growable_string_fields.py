"""A4: can NXstress's string-valued per-scan-point fields be made growable?

To implement 04c's tail-append for the scan-point family, the writer has to stop
emitting those fields as contiguous datasets and start passing
``maxshape=(None,)`` + ``chunks`` (see ``a5_scan_point_family_resizable.py`` for
why). For the numeric fields that is uncontroversial. For the **string-valued**
ones it is not, and this repository has already been bitten twice in that exact
area:

* ``a4_string_log_dtypes.py`` found that a NumPy fixed-width ``<U`` array has no
  h5py conversion path at all and crashes the save outright, which is why
  ``_Sample._writable`` exists; and that the writable variable-length UTF-8
  dtype still reads back as ``bytes``.
* ``a4_h5py_nexusformat_append.py`` confirmed vlen resize works -- but only for
  arrays it created itself as ``np.array([...], dtype=STRING_DTYPE)``.

Neither covers the forms the writer actually uses. ``entry/start_time`` and
``entry/end_time`` are built from a plain Python ``list[str]``
(``NXstress.py:459-460``) and handed to ``NXfield`` with no dtype at all, letting
``nexusformat`` choose. ``SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION/logs/*`` are whatever
``_Sample._writable`` returns, which for a bytes log is an ``|S`` array that
passes through untouched. Adding ``chunks`` moves every one of these off h5py's
contiguous path onto its chunked one.

Claims under test
-----------------
1. New, asserted by no document: a ``list[str]`` handed to ``NXfield`` with
   ``maxshape``/``chunks`` can be written at all -- i.e. the dtype
   ``nexusformat`` infers has a chunked h5py path.
2. New: such a field can be reopened and tail-appended, and the **values**
   round-trip (not merely the shape) -- the ``bytes``-vs-``str`` trap from
   ``a4_string_log_dtypes.py``.
3. New: the same, for the ``|S`` bytes arrays ``_Sample._writable`` passes
   through, and for the explicit vlen UTF-8 dtype it converts ``<U`` into.
4. ``04c-nxstress-append.md:355-359`` -- "appending to an existing (non-empty)
   group grows each dataset by exactly the new row count, with existing rows
   byte-for-byte unchanged and new rows correctly appended after them" --
   measured here for the string cases specifically.
5. New: a **fixed-width** ``|S`` column -- which ``_writable`` passes through
   untouched -- is sized by the longest value present *at write time*. Appending
   a longer one afterwards is the case that cannot be caught by "did it raise",
   so it is measured separately and by value.
