"""A5 [RETIRED -- DOES NOT RUN]: what the landed NXstress library did with our data.

RETIRED
-------
**This probe fails by design and is not evidence of a defect.** Retired to
record by the 04b PR (`7799a673`): claim 5 pinned the *pre-04b* ``write``
signature, and 04b changed exactly that, so re-pointing the probe at
``write([ws], [peaks])`` would erase the one thing it is kept for. It now stops
at ``nxs.write(ws, peaks)`` with a pydantic ``ValidationError`` -- the bare
``HidraWorkspace`` against 04b's list signature. **Any other failure is a real
finding.**

Where each claim went (`process.md` 7.5 item 6 -- supersede, do not delete):

==========  ==========================================================
Claim 1     ``a5_discriminator_resolution.py``, ``a5_subruns_nonmonotonic.py``
Claim 2     **no successor probe** -- read-back completeness is now test
            coverage only (``test_workspace_read.py``,
            ``test_multi_workspace.py``)
Claim 3     ``a5_append_preconditions.py`` (``entry_number`` targeting)
Claim 4     ``a5_append_preconditions.py`` -- **and the claim is now FALSE**
Claim 5     nothing; it is history, which is why this file is kept
==========  ==========================================================

Read the claims below as *what was believed when they were written*, not as
current behaviour. Two are now wrong, and are left unedited for the same reason
the probe is: a log preserves what was believed.

The A4/A5 boundary is **which counterparty, not which interpreter**: a claim
about ``h5py`` is A4, a claim about ``pyrs/utilities/NXstress/`` is A5, because
that library is in this repo and has already landed. These are the claims the
GUI hookup will be built on.

Claims under test
-----------------
1. ``README.md:94-97`` -- "Its input/output types are **exactly** the pair
   ``(HidraWorkspace, list[PeakCollection])`` that PeakFittingViewer and
   TextureFittingViewer already produce and consume."
2. ``README.md:363-367`` -- "``NXstress.read`` reconstructs wavelengths, sample
   logs, masks, reduced diffraction data, and peak collections. It does NOT
   reconstruct raw counts unless the optional ``input_data`` group was written."
3. ``README.md:99-102`` -- "Multiple ``NXentry`` groups per file are supported
   (``NXstress.py:149``)."
4. ``README.md:114-123`` -- "``_input_data.py:44,63`` and ``NXstress.py:151-152``
   raise on any operation that would extend an existing ``NXentry``. Each write
   must currently be a fresh entry (save-as)."

   **NO LONGER TRUE.** 04c implemented the append path and Decisions row 33
   made ``write()`` dispatch on whether the resolved entry exists, so extending
   an existing ``NXentry`` is now the supported case. See
   ``a5_append_preconditions.py``.
5. ``04b:110-115`` -- the **pre-04b** baseline: "Change ``NXstress.write`` to
   accept ``list[HidraWorkspace]`` in place of a single ``HidraWorkspace``".
   Probed here only to pin what the signature was *at the time*.

   **Superseded.** This is the claim that retired the probe. Note that the one
   statement here that still executes -- ``inspect.signature(NXstress.write)``
   -- reports the *post*-04b signature, so its output now contradicts the claim
   heading it prints under. The record of the old signature is this prose, not
   that measurement.

Deliberately NOT probed, and why
--------------------------------
04b's N-workspace round trip, its discriminator resolution, and 04c's append
path **cannot be probed**: none of that code exists yet. Recording the gap is
the point -- afterwards, "no probe was needed" and "no probe was written" look
identical. Those claims stay A5-**uncovered** until 04b and 04c land, and the
coverage matrix says so rather than implying they were checked.

**All three have since landed and all three are now probed** -- by
``a5_subruns_nonmonotonic.py``, ``a5_discriminator_resolution.py`` and
``a5_append_preconditions.py`` respectively. The paragraph above is kept as the
record of a gap that was stated rather than left implicit; it no longer
describes the present.

Do not run: this probe is retired (see RETIRED above).
