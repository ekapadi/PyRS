"""Re-export shared fixtures needed by tests under tests/ui/, plus fixtures shared by its viewers.

Window fixtures
---------------
Each test module builds its viewer in a **function-scoped** fixture on
pytest-qt's `qtbot`, which closes the window after the test (`qtbot.addWidget`),
so no test sees what an earlier one did to a window.

They used to be session-scoped, sharing one window across every test in a module,
"to avoid the segmentation fault error that occurs when the window is created
with a function scope". **We cannot reproduce that segfault**: per-test windows
pass every GUI test locally under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`, run repeatedly.
CI runs under `xvfb-run`, which is not available locally, so CI is the remaining
check -- but nothing found so far ties that segfault to window scope. Sharing the
window, meanwhile, made the tests order-dependent: a texture-fitting test failed
only when run after another test that had left fit-parameter plot axes selected.
