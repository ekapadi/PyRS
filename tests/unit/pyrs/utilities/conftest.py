"""
Shared fixtures for tests of `pyrs/utilities/`.

Fixture conventions
--------------------
- `default_config` — a test-isolated `neutrons_standard.Config` singleton (see
  `pyrs/utilities/config.py`). Every test that requests it gets a genuinely fresh
  instance (`reset_Singletons()`) loaded against a `HOME` pointed at `tmp_path`, so
  a test can never write into (or accidentally read an override from) the real
  user's `~/.pyrs/` directory, and one test's config changes can never leak into
  the next. Required for any test that touches `pyrs.utilities.config.Config` --
  importing that module unconditionally writes a backup file to `~/.pyrs/` as a
  side effect of loading, real home directory included, if not for this fixture.
  Defined here (rather than under `NXstress/`) since `pyrs/utilities/config.py`
  isn't itself NXstress-specific code; being one directory up, it's visible to
  `NXstress/` tests as well as siblings of this file (e.g. `test_config.py`).
- `config_override` — override config values **without** swapping the singleton, so
  that production modules which bound `Config` the documented way still see the
  change. Use this for any test whose subject reads config; use `default_config`
  only when the test is *about* the config machinery itself (reload, `loadEnv`,
  isolation), which is what `test_config.py` does. See `config_override`'s own
  docstring for why the two cannot be the same fixture.

def default_config(tmp_path: Path, monkeypatch: pytest.MonkeyPatch) -> Generator["_Config"]:
    """Yield a `neutrons_standard.Config` singleton, fully isolated from the real environment.

    Setup: monkeypatches `HOME` to `tmp_path` and clears any `env` override, then
    resets and reloads the singleton (both `neutrons_standard.config` and
    `pyrs.utilities.config`) so it picks up the redirected `HOME` -- `reset_Singletons()`
    alone only clears the `Singleton` decorator's internal state; it does not change
    what an already-imported module's `Config` name refers to.

    Cleanup: resets and reloads the singleton again after the test, so the next test
    (or any later code importing `pyrs.utilities.config.Config`) gets a clean instance
    rather than one still holding this test's `tmp_path`-scoped `HOME` or `env`
    override.

    Args:
        tmp_path: Pytest's built-in per-test temporary directory; used as the fake
            `HOME` so `neutrons_standard.Config`'s real side effects (writing a backup
            file to `~/.{package_name}/`) never touch the real user's home.
        monkeypatch: Pytest's built-in fixture for reversible env-var patching.

    Yields:
        The live `neutrons_standard.Config` singleton (via
        `pyrs.utilities.config.Config`), loaded against the isolated `HOME`.
    """
    # `neutrons_standard.Config` is a process-wide singleton: every `reload()` writes a
    # backup to `~/.{package_name}/application.yml.bak`, and it may auto-swap onto a
    # pre-existing `~/.{package_name}/{package_name}-user.yml` override -- both against
    # the REAL home directory, unless we redirect `HOME` first. `reset_Singletons()`
    # alone only clears the Singleton decorator's internal `instance`/`initialized`
    # state; it does not change what an *already-imported* module's `Config` name
    # refers to, so the modules that bind it must also be reloaded.
    #
    # Import order matters and is easy to get backwards: `pyrs.utilities.config` must
    # be imported (or already have been) *before* `neutrons_standard.config` is ever
    # directly touched, because its module body calls `neutrons_standard.init("pyrs")`
    # before importing `Config` -- `neutrons_standard.config`'s own module-level
    # `package_name = Spec.client_package_name` line is captured once, at whichever
    # import happens first. Importing `neutrons_standard.config` here ourselves, ahead
    # of `pyrs.utilities.config`, would reproduce that exact bug.

def config_override() -> Generator[Callable[[dict], None]]:
    """Override config values in place, without replacing the `Config` singleton.

    `default_config` resets and reloads the singleton, which constructs a **new**
    `_Config` instance. Any module that bound the name the documented way --
    `from pyrs.utilities.config import Config`, which is what `config.py`'s
    docstring instructs and what `_instrument.py`, `_discriminator.py` and the
    three viewers all do -- still holds the *previous* instance, and so cannot
    see anything such a test overrides. Measured: with `default_config` active,
    `_Instrument._instrument_names()` returns the shipped default no matter what
    the test configured.

    This fixture never swaps the instance. It deep-merges into the live
    singleton's `_config` -- the same dict `refresh` merges into -- and restores
    a deep copy afterwards. Lookups are live (`__getitem__` reads `_config` on
    every access, with no cache), so every binding sees the change, bound-name
    and module-attribute alike.

    Reaching into `_config` is private access, and is deliberate: the ability to
    override at runtime exists for tests, so the accommodation belongs in a test
    fixture rather than in the shape of production code.

    No `HOME` redirection is needed, because nothing is reloaded and so nothing
    is written: `tests/conftest.py` already performed the one unavoidable
    first-ever import under a throwaway `HOME`.

    Yields:
        A callable taking a nested mapping to deep-merge into the live config,
        e.g. `override({"nxstress": {"discriminator_fields": ["direction"]}})`.
        It may be called more than once; each call merges onto the last.
