"""NXstress append mode: growing an `NXentry` that is already on disk.

A write targets an entry by number, and whether that entry already exists is
what decides between creating it and growing it. Growing is a **tail-append**:
the incoming batch is sorted among itself and added after each dataset's current
end, and nothing already on disk is read back, reordered or rewritten. The
resulting file is "locally sorted, globally segmented" rather than globally
sorted, which is all `_Peaks.peakCollectionRanges` has ever required.

These tests cover the round trip, entry targeting, the three-way
Case A / Case B / duplicate classification, every precondition that makes a
rejected append a true no-op, and the one property the whole design rests on --
that each per-scan-point dataset was written resizable in the first place.
