"""
The run index: every scan point of an entry is identified by `(run_number, scan_point)`.

Every HB2B run numbers its scan points from 1, so two runs in one entry collide on
scan point alone -- and the strain/stress workflow writes three directions, each
its own run, into one entry. Before the run index, NXstress refused any scan point
shared by two workspaces of an entry, whatever their discriminator values, so that
workflow could not be written at all. Measured on the real files: HB2B_1320,
1327, 1328, 1331 and 1332 each number their scan points 1..N.

What is pinned here:

- runs that collide on scan point round-trip, and two runs sharing every
  discriminator value come back as two workspaces;
- a `(run, scan point)` pair repeated across workspaces is refused -- including
  two workspaces with no `run_number` log, which share the configured default;
- a workspace merged from several runs is written alone, and only alone;
- an entry written before the run index still reads exactly as it did;
- a single workspace with no single value for a configured discriminator records
  no boundary, and reads back as one workspace under any configuration;
- a peak tag naming no lattice plane is kept, with hkl `(000)` meaning
  "unknown", and warned about both ways.

Unit tier: synthetic workspaces through `NXstress`'s own write and read, in
`tmp_path`.
