"""The run index: every scan point identified by `(run_number, scan_point)`.

Shows that:

1. four real HB2B runs -- e11 from 1327 and 1328, e22 from 1331, e33 from 1332 --
   each numbering its scan points from 1, are written to **one** entry and read
   back as four workspaces, each with its own run, direction and scan points;
2. on disk, `run_number` sits beside `scan_point` on `peaks` and
   `SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION`, and `peaks@run_number_is_boundary` records that the run
   is part of each workspace's key;
3. a workspace merged from several runs in PyRS, as CombineRuns makes, is
   written alone with the boundary recorded as False, and reads back as one;
4. an entry written before the run index -- no `run_number` column, no boundary
   record -- still reads, every scan point at the configured default run;
5. a peak tag naming no lattice plane (`peak0`, as every strain/stress file in
   `tests/data` uses) is written with hkl (000), meaning "unknown", and read back
   as exactly the tag it was. (The 1327 fixture's tags were renamed `peak000` and
   `peak111` when it was made; the second parses as phase `peak`, hkl (111).)
