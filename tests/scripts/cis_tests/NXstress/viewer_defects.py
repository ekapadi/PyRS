"""Strain/stress viewer defects fixed in phase 3, each shown fixed.

All of these predate phase 3. Shows that:

1. every row of the summary stress CSV has as many cells as its header. A row
   past the end of a direction's data used to carry up to four extra blank
   cells, so every later value sat under the wrong column name;
2. a saved state naming a missing file is reported, and leaves stress
   uncalculated as the window does. It used to raise `AssertionError` out of
   the Load action;
3. a saved state whose peak one direction lacks is not a crash. It used to
   raise `KeyError`;
4. a file with no fitted peaks loads as e22 (it used to raise `IndexError`), and
   in a list of files it is never paired with another file's peaks;
5. a d0 equal to the last one entered is applied again after a reload rebuilds
   the stress. It used to be skipped, so the stress was built without it.
