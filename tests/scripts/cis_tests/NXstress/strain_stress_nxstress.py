"""The strain/stress viewer's NXstress save and load, and its saved state, on real data.

Drives the viewer's model, the same object the window drives, through what the
GUI steps do by hand. Shows that:

1. three real runs -- e11 from 1328, e22 from 1331, e33 from 1332 -- with stress
   calculated, are saved as one `.nxs` file (**Save as NXstress...**);
2. loaded into a fresh model (**Load NXstress...**), every direction comes back
   from its own run, and the stress summary CSV is reproduced. Peak heights
   agree to about 2e-7 relative, not exactly: NXstress stores a pseudo-Voigt fit
   as height, FWHM and form factor in float32 and rebuilds the rest on read.
   Strain and stress are unaffected;
3. the saved state (**File > Save**) of the loaded model names the `.nxs` file
   for each workspace, and restoring it (**File > Load**) in a third model
   reproduces the summary exactly.

Leaves `strain_stress.nxs` and `strain_stress_state.json` in the output directory
for the PR's GUI steps.

Run from the repository root:

    pixi run python tests/scripts/cis_tests/NXstress/strain_stress_nxstress.py [output-dir]
