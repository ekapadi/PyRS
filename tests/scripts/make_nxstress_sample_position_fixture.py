"""Build the NXstress sample-position integration fixture.

Run by hand; not collected by pytest (``tests/scripts`` is in ``norecursedirs``):

    pixi run python tests/scripts/make_nxstress_sample_position_fixture.py

Why this fixture exists
-----------------------
Spec 04's ``## Verification`` asks for a ``.nxs`` written "from a real HB2B
dataset" with ``peaks/sx,sy,sz`` confirmed non-NaN. No file in ``tests/data``
could satisfy that, and the reason is structural rather than accidental --
the requirements are split across two disjoint sets of files:

* writing NXstress at all needs **instrument geometry** and a **peak tag the
  Miller-index parser accepts**;
* non-NaN sample positions additionally need **finite vx/vy/vz**.

Every file with finite ``vx``/``vy``/``vz`` lacks geometry; the one file with
geometry has non-finite coordinates. Recorded as spec 04's Follow-up 7 F7.10.

What is real here, and what is not
----------------------------------
The quantity under test is left untouched. ``vx``/``vy``/``vz`` -- and every
other sample log, the reduced diffraction data and the fit results -- are copied
verbatim from ``HB2B_1327.h5``. A test whose subject were synthesised would be
circular, which is why the base file was chosen for its coordinates rather than
for its geometry.

Two peripheral things are supplied:

1. **Instrument geometry.** ``HB2B_1327.h5`` *has* an
   ``instrument/geometry setup/detector`` group, but it is **empty** -- the three
   datasets it should contain are simply absent, which is why
   ``get_instrument_setup()`` returns ``None``. They are filled in from
   ``HB2B_938_peak.h5``, another real HB2B file in this repository, so the values
   are real instrument parameters rather than invented ones.

2. **Parseable peak tags.** ``_Peaks._parse_peak_tag`` needs a digit run whose
   length is a multiple of three; ``peak0`` and ``peak1`` fail it. They are
   renamed mechanically -- ``peakN`` becomes ``peak`` + the digit repeated three
   times -- giving phase name ``peak`` with Miller indices (0,0,0) and (1,1,1).
   **These indices carry no physical claim**, and nothing is lost by inventing
   them: the source file records ``d reference`` as 1.0 for one peak and NaN for
   the other, so these tags never identified a reflection in the first place.

The ``mask`` group is dropped. It is 8.4 MB of the source file's 11 MB, which
would breach pre-commit's 8 MB ceiling, and NXstress generates a default mask
when a workspace carries none -- so keeping it would cost the repository 8 MB to
exercise nothing this fixture is for.
