"""
The strain/stress viewer's model over project files: its saved state (`Model.to_json` /
`Model.from_json`), and loading a direction from a file it cannot use.

A restore that cannot complete -- a file that fails to load, a peak one direction
lacks, a file with no fitted peaks -- is reported and leaves stress uncalculated,
as the window itself does before it has every input. It never raises out of the
Load action. States naming NXstress files are covered beside the rest of the
NXstress round trip, in `test_nxstress_viewer_roundtrip.py`.

Integration tier: real project files from `tests/data`. Imports only the model,
so the module loads without a display.
