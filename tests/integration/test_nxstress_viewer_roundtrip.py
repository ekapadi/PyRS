"""Integration round-trip tests for spec 02 (NXstress I/O for PeakFitting & Texture
viewers): write via NXstress, read back, assert HidraWorkspace/PeakCollection
equality; and confirm the .h5 suffix still routes through HidraProjectFile
(no regression to the pre-existing path). And the strain/stress viewer: every
loaded direction saved to one `.nxs` file and loaded back.
