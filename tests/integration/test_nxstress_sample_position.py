"""NXstress sample-position export, against a real HB2B dataset.

This is spec 04's `## Verification` step 2 as an executable test: write a `.nxs`
from real data and confirm `peaks/sx,sy,sz` are non-NaN.

The fixture it runs on, `tests/data/HB2B_1327_with_instrument.h5`, exists because
no file in `tests/data` could satisfy that step -- writing NXstress needs
instrument geometry and a parseable peak tag, while non-NaN positions need finite
`vx`/`vy`/`vz`, and those two sets of files were disjoint. It is built by
`tests/scripts/make_nxstress_sample_position_fixture.py`, which documents exactly
what is real in it and what was supplied; the sample coordinates under test are
copied verbatim from `HB2B_1327.h5`.

See spec 04's Follow-up 7 (F7.8, F7.10) and Decisions Log rows 24 and 26 in
`plans/NXstress-prod/README.md`.
